- The app has an AR (Augmented Reality) enabled game that would engage people and increase their interest in travelling by public transport and will also provide them incentives to encourage them to use public transport.
- The AR game will be a mobile application capable of running in mobile phones and tablets of all platforms both Android and iOS and can be played while travelling in a public transport bus.
- To play the game you have to place your phone by the window of the bus and the AR game will show you the greenery and trees that you can save by travelling by public transport and how to roads and nearby places will look if you stop pollution and prefer to travel by public transport.
- While you look through the nice green environment you need to collect points by passing various puzzles and obstacles you face in the game during your journey.
- The points you earn while playing the game can be redeemed for various offers present in the app.
- The app also contains a leaderboard that shows all your friends and the points they have.
